# Scrapster
A smart Python-based lead generation tool that scrapes business information from raw search results using a Tkinter interface.

Scraperster is a Python-based desktop application built with Tkinter that simplifies the process of extracting business contact information from raw search result data. Designed specifically for lead generation purposes, this tool helps users, especially freelancers and software agencies, extract useful business data by simply pasting copied search results into the app. Whether you're targeting restaurants in Brisbane, real estate companies in Los Angeles, or any other business category, Scraperster is built to analyze and extract valuable leads quickly and accurately.

To use Scraperster, launch the Python app and copy any raw search data directly from your browser — for example, by searching "Restaurants in Brisbane," selecting all the results using Ctrl+A, and copying them with Ctrl+C. Paste this raw data into the app’s textbox. The bot will automatically detect URLs from the unstructured text, visit each URL one by one, and intelligently scrape business details such as company name, email address, phone number, address, social media links (Facebook, Instagram), and the source URL. Once the scraping is completed, the bot generates a clean Excel file containing all the collected business information, ready to use for outreach or marketing. Additionally, the app also provides a summary report showing how many URLs were detected, successfully processed, and how many failed.

Scraperster helps small businesses, call centers, and lead generation teams streamline their workflow by eliminating manual data collection. This project is licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to modify, share, or contribute. For any support or feedback, contact [inmujtuba@gmail.com].
